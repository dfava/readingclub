# Reading Club

We are a reading club interested in topics related to programming languages (PL) and formal methods (FM).  Get together to read and discuss research papers that are interesting to us.  The goal is to learn and help each other learn.

#### Topics of interest
- programming languages (PL)
- formal methods (FM)
- the intersection of PL or FM with other areas, such as:
  - security; for example, information flow
  - machine learning; for example, ML for discovering program invariants
  - synthesis; for example, synthesis of programs from examples or specification

See [Organization](https://github.com/dfava/readingclub/wiki/Organization) for how we plan to hold  meetings and [Aspirational rules](https://github.com/dfava/readingclub/wiki/Aspirational-Rules) for guidance on participation.
